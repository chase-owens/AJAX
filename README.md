# Ajax

This was a project in [Udacity's Ajax course](https://www.udacity.com/course/asynchronous-javascript-requests--ud109). The course covers making asynchronous requests using three different methods:

* the XHR object
* jQuery's `.ajax()` method
* the Fetch API


## Project Overview

This project reqires particpants to register developer accounts from Unsplash and The New York Times. The app opens with a search bar underneath the question, 'What are you interested in today?.' 

When users enter a concept of interest, the app displays a picture of that concept from Unsplash and a list of articles related to that concept from the New York Times.
